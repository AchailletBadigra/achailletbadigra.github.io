### Managing Reports and Data Sources
<!--With Amazon SageMaker, billing is based on utilization. By and large, this is same for Google Datalab. However, there are certain perks to their pricing structure that are mostly dependent on customer use-case and demand peculiarities. In general, both Amazon SageMaker and Google Datalab, usually in tandem with other storage and processing infrastructure/ services of their respective cloud hosts (i.e., <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Web Services</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Cloud Platform</a>) offers fair and affordable prices and a convincing reason to consider migrating to the cloud today.-->
