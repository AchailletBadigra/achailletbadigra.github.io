    Welcome to the seminar series on <span style="font-weight: bold; color:green">Building Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models on Google Cloud Platform</span>. This goal of this seminar is to inform, educate and generate interest in the field of analytics, machine learning and deep learning which is termed data science from an industry perspective.
    <br><br>
    This seminar is divided into three parts, each covering:
    <ul style="margin-left: 5%;">
        <li>An Introduction to Google Cloud Platform Infrastructure and Services</li>
        <li>An Introduction to Programming for Data Science</li>
        <li>An Introduction to Machine Learning and Deep Learning</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    This seminar is by no means exhaustive. However, it presents just enough to give a solid conceptual understanding of what these technologies are all about, and how they are currently revolutionizing various sectors. After going through this seminar series, a complete beginner can have a good background to delve deeper and understand more.
