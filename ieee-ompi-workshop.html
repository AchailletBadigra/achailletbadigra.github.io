    Welcome to the workshop on <span style="color:green">Data Science and Machine Learning using Google Cloud Computing</span>. <!--This goal of this seminar is to inform, educate and generate interest in the field of analytics, machine learning and deep learning which is termed data science from an industry perspective.
    <br><br>
    This seminar is divided into four parts, covering:
    <ul style="margin-left: 5%;">
        <li>An Introduction to Google Cloud Platform Infrastructure and Services</li>
        <li>An Introduction to Programming for Data Science</li>
        <li>An Introduction to Machine Learning</li>
        <li>An Introduction to Deep Learning</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    This seminar is by no means exhaustive. However, it presents just enough to give a solid conceptual understanding of what these technologies are all about, and how they are currently revolutionizing various sectors. After going through this seminar series, a complete beginner can have a good background to delve deeper and understand more.
    <br>
    <br>
    Moreso, the contents of this material forms part of my upcoming book with Apress with the same title.
